# portfolio-project-1 : Bike Sales Dashboard
The goal of this project is to help retailers and manufacturers make data driven decisions to improve sales and drive growth.This bike sales project is made using Power BI and it involves steps such as collecting and analyzing data on bike sales to create a dashboard that displays key metrics such as total units sold, revenue generated, and top-selling models. The project includes steps such as gathering data, connecting to Power BI, preparing the data, creating the dashboard, customizing visualizations, publishing and sharing, and continuously monitoring and updating the dashboard with new data. This allows for data-driven decision making and staying on top of sales trends

## Gathering data
Collect sales data for bikes, including information such as the number of units sold, revenue generated, and top-selling models. This data can come from a variety of sources, such as sales reports, customer data, and inventory management systems.

## Connecting to Power BI 
Open Power BI and connect to the data sources where the bike sales data is stored. This could include Excel spreadsheets, databases, or cloud-based data storage systems.

## Preparing the data
Once the data is connected, clean and transform it as needed to ensure it is in the correct format for creating a dashboard. This may involve removing duplicates, merging data from multiple sources, or calculating new fields.

## Creating dashboard
Use the Power BI visualizations to create the bike sales dashboard. Dashboard is generated so that even a layman can understand what are we trying to explain. For doing this we need to represent the complex information into a simpler form by preparing the data. This could include charts, tables, and maps that show key metrics such as total units sold, revenue generated, and top-selling models.

## Customizing Visuals
Use the formatting options in Power BI to customize the visualizations and make them more visually appealing. This could include changing colors, adding labels, or adjusting axis ranges.

## Publish and share
Once the dashboard is complete, publish it to the web or share it with specific users. Power BI allows you to share the dashboard through the cloud, or embed it into a website or application.

## Monitor and update 
Continuously monitor the dashboard and update it with new data as it becomes available. This will allow you to stay on top of trends and make data-driven decisions.
